# Extra Features

Feel free to implement any of the following features if you have time left after completing the [React Client](./ReactClient.md).

  * Create an API server in the `server` directory to return the songs array as JSON (REST or GraphQL) and replace the import of `music.json` with a call to your API.
  * Implement pagination to display a maximum of 2 songs at a time.
