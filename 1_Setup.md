# Setup

We have provided data for you to use in the `song-data.js` file, which will be imported into your app instead of fetching data from an API.

1. Create a JavaScript or TypeScript React app in the `client` directory.
   Note: You may want to use tools such as [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) or [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)
2. If you prefer to use a UI library instead of CSS, install that dependency.
2. Move `song-data.js` (and `song-data.d.ts` if using TypeScript) somewhere that your React app can access (eg `/client/src`).
