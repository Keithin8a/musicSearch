# React Client

Develop the following features one at a time.
We don't expect you to complete them all, but want to see how you work through each task.

1. Display the list of songs from `song-data.js`.
   Each item in the list should display the `title`, `artist`, `year`, and `genres` and have some basic styling to visually separate the songs.
2. Add a text input to the top of the page with a label of "Search".
3. Add functionality so that as a user types into the input, the list only displays songs where the `title` contains the search text.
4. Make the filter case-insensitive.
5. Expand the functionality so that the displays songs where either the `title`, `artist`, `year`, or any of the `genres` contains the search text.
6. Improve performance by filtering only after the user stops typing (ie they have not entered a character for 500ms)

If you still have time left after completing the above, you can work on the [Extra Features](./4_ExtraFeatures.md).
