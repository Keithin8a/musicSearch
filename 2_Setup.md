# Setup

We have provided data for you to use in the `song-data.js` file, which will be imported into your app instead of fetching data from an API.

1. Create a JavaScript or TypeScript React app in the `client` directory.
   Note: You may want to use tools such as [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) or [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) to generate all the boilerplate for you.
2. If there are any other dependencies you would like, install those (eg a UI Library).
2. Move `song-data.js` (and `song-data.d.ts` if using TypeScript) somewhere that your React app can access (eg `/client/src`).
